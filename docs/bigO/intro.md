### What's the idea here?

Imagine we have multiple implementations of the same function

How can we determine which one is the best?

Who cares?

- It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
- Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
- When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
- Less important: it comes up in interviews
- You're become a better engineer

### Timing our code
